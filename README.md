## About The Project

At first I just wanted to replace the fonts, which I couldn't do because of manual work, which caused a lot of errors.

Therefore, to simplify, I made this project. And I replaced the fonts.

But there was another problem - subtitles. And to replace the subtitles, I had to expand this project.

Therefore, I am posting this project here in the hope that it will be useful to someone.

## Usage

I will write something here when I bring the project to a more or less effective state
